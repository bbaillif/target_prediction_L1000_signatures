# Objective

This folder contains code related to the Frontiers in Chemistry publication :
[Exploring the Use of Compound-Induced Transcriptomic Data Generated From Cell Lines to Predict Compound Activity Toward Molecular Targets](https://doi.org/10.3389/fchem.2020.00296)

The goal of this code is to preprocess data coming from the LINCS (CMap/L1000) and Pubchem (meta)data and to produce the figures, tables and most importantly models presented in the publication.
